🏦 Bancassurance Agent Policy Management System
📌 Project Overview
1. Context, Goals, and Strategic Impact
🔍 Problem Statement (Current State)

Current bancassurance operations rely heavily on fragmented, paper-based, and manual processes, which result in:

Slow processing times during client onboarding and policy servicing

High error rates due to manual data handling

Poor tracking of claims, appeals, and commission statements

Limited real-time visibility for agents, managers, and finance teams

These challenges reduce operational efficiency and limit the scalability of bancassurance operations.

🎯 Business Goal (Proposed Solution)

The goal of this project is to develop a centralized, scalable, and fully digital bancassurance platform that provides end-to-end lifecycle management, including:

Agent registration and management

Client onboarding

Policy issuance, servicing, and maturity

Claims processing and payout

Commission tracking and reporting

📈 Strategic Impact

The system delivers measurable strategic value by:

Enabling tighter operational control

Significantly reducing processing errors

Improving agent productivity

Providing real-time transparency across departments

Ensuring automated regulatory and compliance alignment

This platform serves as a foundation for accelerating bancassurance revenue growth and future digital expansion.
